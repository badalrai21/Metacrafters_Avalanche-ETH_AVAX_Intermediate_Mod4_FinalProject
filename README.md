# Introduction to FantasyToken (ERC20)

Welcome to the FantasyToken project, an ERC20-compliant token designed for a fantasy-themed gaming environment. This smart contract allows players to earn, trade, and redeem tokens for various in-game items. The contract includes essential functionalities such as minting, transferring, burning tokens, and redeeming fantasy items like heals, potions, swords, shields, and magic artifacts.

## Description

### Key Features
#### ➛ Minting New Tokens:
The owner can mint new tokens and distribute them to players who purchase tokens. Players are added to a queue, and tokens are minted and distributed accordingly.  
  
#### ➛ Transferring Tokens:
Players can transfer their tokens to other players, enabling a dynamic in-game economy.  
  
#### ➛ Redeeming Fantasy Items:
Players can redeem their tokens for in-game items such as heals, potions, swords, shields, and magic. Each item has a specific token cost, promoting strategic gameplay.      
  
#### ➛ Checking Token Balance:
Players can check their token balance at any time to keep track of their resources.    
  
#### ➛ Burning Tokens:
Players can burn tokens they no longer need, helping to manage the total token supply and maintaining a balanced in-game economy.  

## Getting Started

### Installing

* How/where to download your program
* Any modifications needed to be made to files/folders

### Executing program

#### Prerequisites

➛ MetaMask: A browser extension wallet for interacting with Ethereum-based applications.

#### Deployment on Remix IDE
1. Open the remix ide in your web browser.
2. Create a new file in Remix IDE.
3. Compile the contract by selecting the appropriate Solidity compiler version in Remix IDE and clicking the "Compile" button.
4. Connect MetaMask to Remix IDE by clicking on the MetaMask extension icon in your browser and following the instructions to log in.
5. Deploy the contract by clicking the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in Remix IDE.
6. Click the "Deploy" button to deploy the contract to the selected testnet.
7. Confirm the transaction in MetaMask and wait for the contract to be deployed. Once deployed, you will see the contract address in the Remix IDE.

#### Connection
1. Go to Snowtrace website.

2. Copy the contract address from Remix IDE and paste into the search bar on the Snowtrace.

3. You can now get the informations about the functions.
